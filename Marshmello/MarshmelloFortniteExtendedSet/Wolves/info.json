"lyrics":"Written by: Alexandra Leah Tamposi, Andrew Watt, Brian Lee, Carl Rosen, Louis Bell, Marshmello, Selena Gomez\n\nIn your eyes there's a heavy blue\nOne to love and one to lose\nSweet divine, the heavy truth\nWater or wine, don't make me choose\nI wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night\nDrunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky\nI've been running through the jungle\nI've been running with the wolves\nTo get to you, to get to you\nI've been down the darkest alleys\nSaw the dark side of the moon\nTo get to you, to get to you\nI've looked for love in every stranger\nTook too much to ease the anger\nAll for you, yeah, all for you\nI've been running through the jungle\nI've been crying with the wolves\nTo get to you, to get to you, (Oh, to get to you)"}]
