"lyrics":"Written by: Avicii\n\nWhere there's a will, there's a way, kind of beautiful\nAnd every night has its day, so magical\nAnd if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle\nThat can't be defeated\n\nFor every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable\nIn every lost soul the bones of a miracle\nFor every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable\nWith something to believe in\n\nMonday left me broken\nTuesday I was through with hoping\nWednesday my empty arms were open\nThursday waiting for love, waiting for love\nThank the stars it's Friday\nI'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday\nGuess I won't be coming to church on Sunday\n\nI'll be waiting for love, waiting for love\nTo come around\n\n"}]
