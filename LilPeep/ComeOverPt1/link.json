"tale":"Gustav Åhr, a.k.a. Long Island’s emo-rap prodigy Lil Peep, masters the art of dejection on his debut album, Come Over When You’re Sober, Pt. 1. Mixing live guitar samples, reverbed trap beats, and howling lead vocals, Peep formulates a haunting tour through his own personal hell, whether he’s slurring words on the drug-addled opener, \"Benz Truck (гелик),\" or leading a downcast shout-along on \"Better Off (Dying).\" His music may be dark, but Peep finds a way to make it shine."}]
