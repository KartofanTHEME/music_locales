"lyrics":"Written by: Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, Thomas Bangalter\n\nWhat's going on? (Work it harder, make it better)\nCould this be my understanding? (Do it faster, makes us stronger)\nIt's not your fault (More than ever, hour after hour)\nI was being too demanding (Work is never over)\n\nI must admit (Work it harder, make it better)\nIt's my pride that made me distant (Do it faster, makes us stronger)\nAll because (More than ever, hour after hour)\nI hoped that you'd be someone different (Work is never over)\n\n(Work it harder, make it better)\nThere's not much I know about you (Do it faster, makes us stronger)\n(More than ever, hour after hour)\nFear will always make you blind (Work is never over)\n(Work it harder, make it better)\nBut the answer is in clear view (Do it faster, makes us stronger)\n(More than ever, hour after hour)\nIt's amazing what you'll find face to face (Work is never over)\nAmazing what you'll find face to face (Work it harder, make it better)\nAmazing what you'll find face to face (Do it faster, makes us stronger)\nAmazing what you'll find face to face (More than ever, hour after hour)\nAmazing what you'll find face to face (Work is never over)\nAmazing what you'll find face to face (Work it harder, make it better)\nAmazing what you'll find face to face (Do it faster, makes us stronger)\nAmazing what you'll find face to face (More than ever, hour after hour)\nAmazing what you'll find face to face (Work is never over)\n\nWhat's going on?
